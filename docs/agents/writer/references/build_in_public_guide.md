# Build in Public Style Guide

## What is Build in Public?

Build in Public (BiP) is a content strategy where creators and entrepreneurs share their journey of building products, companies, or projects openly and transparently. Instead of only announcing finished products, you share the process: the wins, the struggles, the learnings, and the failures.

### Core Principles

1. **Transparency**: Share real numbers, real challenges, real outcomes
2. **Authenticity**: Be yourself, don't put on a corporate mask
3. **Consistency**: Regular updates, not just major milestones
4. **Value-First**: Help others learn from your experience
5. **Community**: Engage with your audience, don't just broadcast

## Why Build in Public?

**For You:**
- Builds an audience before launch
- Gets early feedback and validation
- Creates accountability
- Establishes authority and trust
- Generates free marketing through storytelling

**For Your Audience:**
- Educational content they can learn from
- Authentic connection with the creator
- Behind-the-scenes access
- Opportunity to influence the product
- Entertainment value of following a journey

## The Build in Public Spectrum

```
Private ←――――――――――――――――――――――――――→ Radical Transparency
│                      │                      │
"Black box"        "Highlights         "Everything
releases           & learnings"         open"
```

**Most successful BIP is in the middle:**
- Share significant updates and learnings (YES)
- Share private customer data or sensitive info (NO)
- Share revenue/growth when comfortable (OPTIONAL)
- Share challenges and failures (YES)
- Share every single commit or minor tweak (NO)

## Content Pillars

### 1. Progress Updates
**What to share:**
- Features shipped
- Milestones reached
- Metrics/growth
- Before/after comparisons

**Example:**
"Reached 1,000 users this week 🎉

Started from 0 six months ago. Growth was slow at first (10 users/week) but picked up after we:
- Added dark mode
- Fixed onboarding flow
- Started content marketing

The compound effect is real."

---

### 2. Technical Deep Dives
**What to share:**
- Interesting implementations
- Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Performance optimizations
- Architecture choices

**Example:**
"Why we chose Postgres over MongoDB for our SaaS 💾

Tried MongoDB first. Hit a wall with:
- Complex joins (Product ↔ User ↔ Team)
- ACID transactions needed
- Schema evolved too fast

Postgres gave us:
✓ Rock-solid reliability
✓ JSON columns for flexibility
✓ Amazing ecosystem

Sometimes boring tech is the right choice."

---

### 3. Lessons Learned
**What to share:**
- Mistakes made and recovered from
- Assumptions that were wrong
- What you'd do differently
- Advice for others

**Example:**
"Spent 2 months building the wrong feature 😅

Lesson learned: Talk to users FIRST, build SECOND.

We assumed power users wanted advanced analytics. They actually wanted better export options.

Could've saved 2 months by doing 5 user interviews. Rookie mistake but won't happen again."

---

### 4. Behind the Scenes
**What to share:**
- Development process
- Tool stack choices
- Workflow and productivity
- Team collaboration

**Example:**
"Our dev workflow for shipping fast 🚀

1. Feature idea in Linear
2. 15-min spec doc (not more!)
3. Build in feature branch
4. Self-review first
5. PR with video demo
6. Ship to staging, test
7. Production deploy
8. Monitor for 24h

Key: Keep PRs small. Ship daily if possible."

---

### 5. Challenges & Struggles
**What to share:**
- Current roadblocks
- Things you're wrestling with
- Requests for advice
- Honest reflections

**Example:**
"Hitting a wall with user retention 📉

Acquisition is good (100 signups/week) but only 30% come back after day 1.

Tried:
- Better onboarding emails ❌
- In-app tutorials ❌
- Push notifications ❌

What am I missing? Anyone solved this before?"

---

### 6. Wins & Celebrations
**What to share:**
- Achievements (big and small)
- Positive user feedback
- Revenue milestones
- Team successes

**Example:**
"First $10K revenue month 💰

Not life-changing money yet, but proof that people value what we're building.

Breakdown:
- $6K from Pro plans
- $3K from Teams
- $1K from one-time purchases

Next goal: $15K by end of Q2.

To everyone who supported us: Thank you! 🙏"

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### ✅ DO Sound Like This

**Conversational:**
- "We're working on..."
- "Here's what I learned..."
- "Anyone else struggle with this?"
- "Let me show you..."

**Humble:**
- "Still figuring this out..."
- "Made a rookie mistake..."
- "Not sure this is the best approach..."
- "Open to better ideas..."

**Specific:**
- "Response time dropped from 1.2s to 480ms"
- "40% of users clicked the new button"
- "Took 3 days to debug"
- "Rewrote it 4 times"

**Enthusiastic:**
- "So excited about..."
- "Can't wait to share..."
- "This is going to be awesome..."
- "Really proud of this..."

### ❌ DON'T Sound Like This

**Corporate:**
- "We are pleased to announce..."
- "Our cutting-edge solution..."
- "Industry-leading platform..."
- "Synergies and stakeholders..."

**Arrogant:**
- "Obviously the best way is..."
- "Everyone should do it like this..."
- "I knew this would work..."
- "It was easy for me..."

**Vague:**
- "Made some updates"
- "Working on stuff"
- "Things are going well"
- "Improvements were made"

**Overly Negative:**
- "Everything is terrible"
- "This project is doomed"
- "I'm the worst developer"
- "Nothing ever works"

---

## Content Structure

### The Hook (First 1-2 Lines)
**Purpose**: Make people stop scrolling

**Effective hooks:**
- Surprising numbers: "Reduced our AWS bill by 80%"
- Confessions: "I almost quit building this..."
- Questions: "Ever wondered why X?"
- Announcements: "Just shipped the feature I've been dreaming about"
- Lessons: "Here's what 6 months of building taught me"

**Weak hooks:**
- "Update time" (boring, vague)
- "Here's a thread" (obvious, adds no value)
- "Been working hard" (everybody works hard)

### The Body (Middle Tweets/Sections)
**Purpose**: Deliver value and substance

**Structure options:**

**Problem → Solution:**
```
1. Here was the challenge...
2. We tried X, didn't work
3. Then we tried Y, better
4. Final solution: Z
```

**Before → After:**
```
1. Where we started...
2. What we changed...
3. Where we are now...
4. What we learned...
```

**Step-by-Step:**
```
1. First we did X...
2. Then Y...
3. Finally Z...
4. Results: ...
```

**Insight → Evidence:**
```
1. Main lesson learned
2. Why it matters
3. Data/example supporting it
4. How to apply it
```

### The Close (Final Tweet/Section)
**Purpose**: Drive engagement and action

**Good closes:**
- **Question**: "What's your approach to this?"
- **CTA**: "Try it out: [link]"
- **Acknowledgment**: "Thanks to everyone who helped!"
- **Invitation**: "Would love your feedback on..."
- **Tease**: "More on this next week..."

**Weak closes:**
- Ending abruptly with no engagement hook
- "That's all for now" (adds nothing)
- Just hashtags with no substance

## Frequency & Timing

### How Often to Post?

**Daily**: Only if you have substantial updates
- Risk: Running out of things to say
- Benefit: High visibility

**2-3x per week**: Recommended for most
- Risk: Minimal
- Benefit: Consistent presence without burnout

**Weekly**: Minimum viable frequency
- Risk: Losing momentum/visibility
- Benefit: Each post is high-quality

**Ad-hoc/as things happen**: Not recommended
- Risk: Inconsistent, easily forgotten
- Benefit: All posts are significant

### Best Times to Post

**Twitter/X:**
- Weekdays 9am-11am (early morning scroll)
- Weekdays 1pm-3pm (lunch break)
- Evenings 7pm-9pm (after work)

**LinkedIn:**
- Tuesday-Thursday 8am-10am
- Lunch times 12pm-1pm
- Early evening 5pm-6pm

**General rule**: Post when YOUR audience is active. Test and measure.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Only Sharing Wins
**Problem**: Comes across as fake, braggy
**Solution**: Share struggles and setbacks too. Authenticity builds trust.

### 2. Sharing Everything
**Problem**: Info overload, noise, privacy concerns
**Solution**: Be selective. Not every commit needs a post. Focus on learnings.

### 3. No Clear Value
**Problem**: "Day 47 of building" with no substance
**Solution**: Every post should teach, inspire, or entertain. Give value.

### 4. Ignoring Engagement
**Problem**: Post and ghost - doesn't build community
**Solution**: Reply to comments, answer questions, engage back.

### 5. Being Inconsistent
**Problem**: Post 10 times one week, disappear for a month
**Solution**: Set a sustainable cadence and stick to it.

### 6. Too Much Hype
**Problem**: "GAME CHANGING! REVOLUTIONARY!" loses credibility
**Solution**: Let your work speak. Be excited but don't oversell.

### 7. No Story Arc
**Problem**: Random updates with no context
**Solution**: Help followers understand the journey. Reference previous posts.

### 8. Oversharing Sensitive Info
**Problem**: Customer data, internal conflicts, proprietary tech
**Solution**: Have a mental filter. When in doubt, don't share.

- Brand awareness
- Partnership/collab opportunities

### Intangible Benefits
- Learning by teaching
- Accountability to keep building
- Connections made
- Ideas and feedback received

**Remember**: BiP is a long game. Consistent value over 6-12 months compounds.
