# Casual Content Examples

Real examples of the tone we're going for. These sound like humans, not content machines.

## Twitter/X Examples

### Launch Example (Good)

```
shipped the thing

been building an automation that turns my github activity into posts

sounds dumb but I kept forgetting to share what I'm working on

now it reads my commits and drafts posts for me to approve

still need to actually approve everything so no robot takeover yet
```

Why it works:
- Starts with action, no context needed
- Self-aware ("sounds dumb but")
- Explains benefit simply
- Ends with personality

### Launch Example (Bad - Too Structured)

```
🚀 Excited to announce the launch of my new automation system!

Here's what it does:
• Reads GitHub commits
• Generates content drafts  
• Sends to Typefully for publishing

This will revolutionize how I share my work!

Try it: [link]

#BuildInPublic #AI #Automation
```

Why it's bad:
- "Excited to announce" = instant AI tell
- Bullet points = over-structured
- "Revolutionize" = marketing speak
- Too many hashtags

---

### Progress Update (Good)

```
week 2 of the content agent thing

got the notion sync working. now I can approve posts from my phone

next: making the actual posts less robotic. they're too formal right now

building in public means you get to watch me iterate on this in real time
```

Why it works:
- Casual numbering ("week 2")
- Honest about current state ("too formal")
- Invites following along

### Progress Update (Bad - Too Polished)

```
📊 Week 2 Progress Report

✅ Completed: Notion bidirectional sync
📱 Result: Mobile approval workflow enabled
🎯 Next Sprint: Content quality improvements

Key metrics:
- Sync latency: 60s
- Error rate: 0%

#BuildInPublic #ProductivityHack
```

Why it's bad:
- "Progress Report" = corporate
- Check marks and sprint language
- Metrics nobody asked for
- Hashtag overkill

---

### Struggle/Victory Story (Good)

```
spent 3 hours debugging why posts weren't syncing

thought it was the API. rewrote it twice.

turns out I had the wrong timezone. my server was in UTC, the API expected local time.

one line fix after 3 hours of suffering

classic
```

Why it works:
- Relatable pain
- Shows the journey
- Humble ending
- "classic" = self-aware humor

### Struggle/Victory Story (Bad)

```
🐛 Bug Fix Story: Timezone Synchronization Issue

The Problem:
Posts weren't syncing between our local state and the cloud API.

Investigation:
- Checked API integration ❌
- Rewrote authentication flow ❌
- Analyzed timestamp handling ✅

Root Cause:
Server UTC vs. client local time created a timezone mismatch in token validation.

Solution:
Normalized all timestamps to UTC before comparison.

Key Takeaway: Always validate timezone handling in distributed systems!

```

Why it's bad:
- Too structured (headers, sections)
- "Key Takeaway" = educational tone
- Check marks make it feel like a case study
- No personality

## LinkedIn Examples

### Launch (Good)

```
quietly shipped something last week

I kept forgetting to post about what I'm building. like, I'd finish a feature, feel good about it, then forget to tell anyone.

so I built a system that watches my github and drafts posts for me. I still approve everything - not letting AI post on my behalf. but it reminds me what I did and gives me a starting point.

kind of meta that the first thing it helped me post about is itself

if you're bad at sharing your work too, might build this into something others can use. lmk if that's interesting.
```

Why it works:
- Lowercase "quietly shipped" = humble
- Honest about the problem (forgetting)
- Clear about human control
- Ends with genuine ask
- No hashtag spam

### Launch (Bad)

```
🚀 Thrilled to Announce: My New AI-Powered Content Automation System

After months of development, I'm excited to share what I've been working on.

THE PROBLEM:
As builders, we often forget to share our journey. The work consumes us, and marketing takes a back seat.

THE SOLUTION:
I've built a multi-agent AI system that:
✅ Monitors GitHub activity
✅ Analyzes code changes semantically
✅ Generates platform-specific content
✅ Maintains human-in-the-loop approval

THE TECH STACK:
• OpenCode for orchestration
• MCP (Model Context Protocol)
• Typefully integration
• Git-based state management

This is a game-changer for developers who want to build in public without the content overhead.

What do you think? I'd love your feedback!

#BuildInPublic #AI #DeveloperTools #ContentAutomation #AgenticAI #IndieHacker
```

Why it's bad:
- "Thrilled to Announce" = instant skip
- ALL CAPS headers
- Bullet point overload
- "Game-changer"
- 6 hashtags
- Sounds like a product launch, not a person sharing

---

### Insight/Decision (Good)

```
switched from trying to auto-post to just auto-drafting

the idea of AI posting without my approval felt wrong. even if it was "good enough" 90% of the time, that 10% could be embarrassing.

now I get a notification, read the draft, tweak if needed, tap approve.

takes 2 minutes but I actually own what goes out

sometimes more friction is better
```

Why it works:
- Shows thinking process
- Honest about concerns
- Practical outcome
- Ends with insight, not takeaway

---

## Threads Examples (Extra Casual)

### Launch

```
okay so I made a thing

it reads my github and writes tweets about what I'm building

I still have to approve everything, I'm not that brave

but now I actually remember to post instead of just coding in silence

link in bio if you want to see the repo
```

### Progress

```
content bot update

made the posts less AI-sounding. they were too formal before

still not perfect but better

the trick was telling it to write like it's texting not blogging
```

### Struggle

```
debugging for 2 hours

the bug: posts weren't syncing
the cause: wrong timezone

I hate it here
```

## The Vibe We Want

**Sounds like:**
- A developer friend sharing in a group chat
- Someone excited but not trying to sell you anything
- Honest about limitations and struggles
- Inviting you to follow along, not teaching you

**Doesn't sound like:**
- A company announcement
- A technical blog post
- A LinkedIn influencer
- An AI that read too many marketing guides

## Quick Transforms

| If you catch yourself writing... | Replace with... |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| "I'm excited to announce" | "shipped" / "it's live" / "finally done" |
| "Here's what I learned" | "turns out" / "honestly didn't expect" |
| "The key takeaway is" | just end naturally |
| "In this thread I'll cover" | just start |
| "Let me break this down" | just break it down |
| "What are your thoughts?" | "anyone else deal with this?" |
| Headers and sections | just paragraphs |
| Perfect bullet points | messy casual lists or none |
