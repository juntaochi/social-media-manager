# The Agent Content Engine is Live

## The Story
I finally got the core multi-agent pipeline working for this social media manager. It's a system where specialized agents (Analyst, Writer, Publisher) work together to turn my messy GitHub commits into actual "Build in Public" stories. The coolest part is the human-in-the-loop gate: I use Notion as a dashboard to approve or tweak drafts from my phone before anything goes live.

## Deep Dive Findings
- **Implementation**: The system uses a `Manager-Agent` orchestration model where a central agent manages ticket state and dispatches sub-agents (Analyst, Writer, Publisher).
- **Transparency**: Every content piece is a Git-tracked Markdown ticket in `data/tickets/`.
- **Approval Flow**: Bidirectional sync with Notion via `scripts/bridge_tickets.py` allows mobile status updates (e.g., flipping a status from `proposed` to `approved` on the go).
- **Safety**: Human-in-the-loop is enforced via the `waiting_approval` status before the Writer agent can proceed.

## Suggested Frame
"I'm launching X" / "I'm building X and here's where I'm at"

## Key Details
- Multi-agent system (Analyst, Writer, Publisher) powered by OpenCode + MCP.
- File-based state (Markdown tickets) keeps it transparent and Git-trackable.
- Bidirectional Notion sync for mobile approvals.
- Focuses on "stories" (struggles, victories) rather than just technical updates.

## Media Opportunity
- Screenshot of the Notion dashboard showing ticket statuses.
- Terminal screenshot of `./scripts/monitor.sh` dashboard.
