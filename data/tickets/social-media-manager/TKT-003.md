draft_content: "hardest part of this project wasn't the code. it was making the AI writer not sound like AI. kept generating stuff like 'I'm thrilled to announce' and 'game-changing'. so I built a banned phrases list. now it writes like it's texting instead of publishing a press release"

# Teaching AI to Sound Less Like AI

## The Story
One of the hardest parts of this project wasn't the orchestration—it was the tone. I noticed the Writer agent was defaulting to "I'm thrilled to announce" and using too many bullet points. I built a `voice_calibration.md` system that explicitly bans "AI slop" and teaches the model to write like it's texting a dev friend. The difference in authenticity is night and day.

## Deep Dive Findings
- **The "Hard Ban" List**: `docs/agents/writer/references/voice_calibration.md` includes a strict list of banned terms like "game-changing", "delve", and "harness".
- **Structure Shifts**: The system now favors "one sentence hooks" and casual sentence starters like "finally got X working" over formal announcements.
- **Vibe Test**: Added a "Vibe Test" protocol: "Would I actually say this to a friend at a coffee shop?".
- **Impact**: Shifted the narrative from "explaining architecture" to "sharing a story", resulting in significantly more authentic drafts.

## Suggested Frame
"I just figured out X" / "Switched from X to Y, here's why"

## Key Details
- Created `docs/agents/writer/references/voice_calibration.md`.
- Implemented a "Hard Ban" list for marketing fluff (e.g., "game-changing", "delve").
- Shifted focus from "explaining architecture" to "sharing a story".
- Uses natural sentence starters like "finally got X working" instead of formal announcements.

## Media Opportunity
- Before/After comparison of a post draft.
- Snippet of the `voice_calibration.md` file.
